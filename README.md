This project demonstrates the use of scikit-learn to load a dataset, perform data preprocessing, and apply machine learning models to classify the Iris dataset. The following steps are included:

Loading and Preprocessing the Data

Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Training and Evaluating a Random Forest Classifier

Training and Evaluating a K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier


Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn

Results

Both classifiers (Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors) achieved an accuracy of approximately 97.78% on the testing set.
